# Hi Mic!
Thank you for taking the time to look at my project. To install, just run npm install from within the directory and npm run start to open up the web page.

### Tech used:
I built the front-end in React.js and called the first set of the data from within the app and the second set I hosted on Firebase.

### Issues:

I did run into some issues with integrating the more-articles without a backend. For some reason that I haven't been able to unpack, when I used axios to call the file, which I have done many times before in previous projects, it would log my index.html page to the console. A similar issue with the rendering of the firebase data that did not seem rooted in anything. I believe that I spent a bit too much time trying to sort out these issues, but I look forward to chatting with you about what you think is going on! Additionally, rendering the third set of data requires the user to click the load more button twice for some inexplicable reason. I hope that these setbacks won't negatively impact my application.

### Conclusion:
I had so much fun on this challenge. I have always wanted to work in a media and am excited at the prospect of working with you. I look forward to chatting in person and hope that you have a lovely day!
